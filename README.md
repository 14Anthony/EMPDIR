# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

## Acceptance Criteria

The user should be able to:

- If you click on the name the name will be filtered out 

- You will be able to change the name thru the input on each individual
